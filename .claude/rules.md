# Global Workspace Rules
- **Package Manager**: Always use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh) for dependency management.
- **Project Structure**: Maintain strict isolation between sub-projects in the monorepo.
- **Language**: Use modern Python (3.12+) with type hints and succinct logic.
- **Context**: Focus specifically on IT and Tech sector roles relevant to the Seattle market.

# Test Data
- **Test Data**: Store all shared sample resumes and JDs in `tests/data/`.
- **Benchmarking**: Use `tests/data/sample_resume.txt` as the default input for regression tests.
